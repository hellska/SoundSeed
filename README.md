# Description

Sound Seed is a software synthesizer that bind together granular synthesis, cellular automata and feature extraction techniques as defined in the music information retrieval (MIR) discipline. The project aims to develop a musical instrument where a cellular automata is used to control the temporal and spectral characteristics of a granular synthesis. The project is named Sound Seed cause the sintesized sound preserves some characteristics of an arbitrary chosen sound, this sound is the *seed*, it's an audio file or a sound input and is binded to the sintesized sound trough the mapping between the synthesis parameters and the seed features extracted with MIR techniques. A GUI is used for the interaction between the user and the software.
